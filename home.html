					<h2>Game of the Year 2022</h2>
					<p>The Game Awards is a night of celebration for some of the biggest and best titles a year has given gamers. Alongside the awards, a lot of fans also look forward to the big teases and reveals that can happen, such as when Alan Wake 2 was announced at The Game Awards 2021. However, people all over the world will tune in on December 8 this year to see which of their favorite games from 2022 are crowned as the best in their given category, with the biggest prize to take home being the Game of the Year award.Even with a lot of games being pushed into next year, 2022 has still had some stand-out titles, as shown by the nominees from this year's Game of the Year category. Elden Ring, Stray, God of War: Ragnarok, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Horizon Forbidden West, and A Plague Tale: Requiem are all in the running to take home the grand prize at this year's The Game Awards. With each of these titles each earning a great reception from fans and critics, it appears difficult to predict which will be crowned Game of the Year. But, as many have already pointed out, it seems the prize is up for grabs between two main competitors.While all the games on this list deserve to be on it, and more than a couple could've taken home Game of the Year on another occasion, in 2022 the competition is too stiff, and it all seems to point to either God of War: Ragnarok or Elden Ring taking home the big prize. God of War: Ragnarok is likely to sweep The Game Awards 2022 in other categories, but it seems the Game of the Year award is slightly more poised to go to Elden Ring.This category could go either way, and a lot of social media is ablaze right now with debates over which title should win between God of War: Ragnarok and Elden Ring. Still, FromSoftware's triumphant, open-world epic seems as if it has a bit more of a lead. With players still pouring hundreds of hours into Elden Ring months after release, the game has proven it's got staying power. Also, it has shown to be FromSoftware's best-selling game to date, which means there are likely a lot of Tarnished out there wanting to vote for the RPG.</p>

					<h2>Twitter is Dead Lmao</h2>
					<p>In his first chaotic weeks as Twitter's owner, Elon Musk has repeatedly called back to a decade-old metaphor for the site: Twitter is a global “town square.”The description — which Musk owes to former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo — envisions Twitter as a place where the masses convene to share what they find interesting, meaningful or momentous and talk it over with others. Facebook didn’t describe itself as a town square but it was founded on a similar principle.But Musk or no Musk, the vision of a global town square is dead. We have seen too much and we don’t want to look, listen or trust the squabbling voices squashed together in one place.That’s why there may never be anything like Twitter or Facebook again. The world is too divided and discordant for any app to bring us together.This vision of connecting the world and convening the masses was always partly fictional and wholly problematic. But the idea also has wisps of beauty and truth.Even if you never used Twitter or reluctantly waded onto Facebook, you gained something from the hope baked into social media. In there was the desire to expand your human interactions beyond the physical world and an implicit desire to better understand one another.Broadcasting to the world can be profound and useful. In the hands of a Minneapolis teenager, Darnella Frazier, social media helped reveal the murder of George Floyd. It is empowering people in Iran to show the world and one another their determination to win freedom. We joked together about llamas on the loose that one time. It could also show or encourage the worst of us.No matter what, many starry-eyed Silicon Valley technologists are no longer imagining bringing billions together with a shared purpose. A principle of cryptocurrency and the related blockchain technology is that no one can be trusted and no one knows anything, as Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey said in some recent tweets. Essentially, the dream of a global town square is for suckers.What we have instead of a town square is an explosion of private parties. The text-and-audio app Discord, Snapchat, Twitch, Truth Social, group text chats and Zoom are about mingling with people we choose to be with.There are still billions of people using Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, WhatsApp and WeChat in China. But the town square principle is fraying.You’re not on YouTube to hear everyone but to scatter into self-selected communities around Mr. Beast, “CoComelon” or that guy roasting the perfect Thanksgiving turkey. Reddit, Substack and Tumblr function this way, too. Twitter itself may have always been best not as a central square but as smaller communities of interest or identity, like Black Twitter or UFC fans.</p>
